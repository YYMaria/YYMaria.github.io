							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Beyond just fonts, we should also look at font pairing inspiration. Font pairing is just as important as the fonts themselves.
								When it comes to choosing our font types, we need to follow the principles: readability, legibility, and purpose.
								also that we can create a styleguide for our typography to help standardize type across our designs.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In terms of font pairing, i didn't know keeping it simple with a maximum of three different fonts is this important and would make our page aesthetically pleasing. In addition, pair fonts that contrast one another. Doing so also help guide the eyes of readers, first to headers and then to body texts.
								Create visual contrast using different font sizes, colors, and weights.
								For web fonts, we can use Google Fonts, which I find really cool and explored around.</p>
