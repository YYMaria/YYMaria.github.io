						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> That the optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms, 
								this is because the duration of the animation should be slow enough to give users the possibility to notice the change, 
								but at the same time quick enough not to cause waiting.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Equal interaction means that the appearance of all objects obeys to one particular rule.
								In that case, the appearance of all cards is perceived as one flow that guides user’s attention in one direction, namely from the top to down. 
								If we don’t follow the order, the user’s attention will be scattered. The appearance of all elements at once would look bad as well. I find this very interesting as this is a common pattern that appears in every interactive websites/games I use nowdays.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Subordinate interaction means that we have one central object which attracts all user’s attention, and all other elements are subordinate to it. This type of animation gives the sense of order and draws more attention to the main content." </p>
