    <li>it is important to train yourself to observe and analyze designs around you. Pay attention to how different elements are arranged, the use of colors, typography, and overall layout
        Also I learned that developing an eye for design requires practice. Therefore we should experiment with different design tools, work on personal projects, and seek opportunities to apply your skills.

    <li>her observation on the placeholder of the text got me thinking of ways to draw the user's attension in designes by giving them potential ideas and inspirations.</li>
    <li>"The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."</li>
